1. I like to create humanoid robots insurance as a service.
2. the best practise is to use 
    - python 3.12 and python frameworks
    - using azure cloud with container app
    - postgresql
    - github ci/cd to deploy the service on cloud
    - the cloud crendential can be save in the enviroment and .evn file
    - expose API as openai 3.0 as spec in tech.
    - using uv as python dependency management as project
    - using pulumi to initilize all the cloud infrastructure, under infrastucture folder
